# Introduction #

This page contains the current status of the project, and should be the best place to find new things to fill up your everyday existence. But at the present time it's obviously lacking in helpful information.

# Status #

The following sections will try to introduce the status of the current major areas of our XNA implementation.

## Graphics ##

The GraphicsDevice implementation has not yet really been started. There are a couple of problems that must be overcome on the way eg. SDL 1.2 "rough" API.

### 2D Graphics ###

The 2D graphics interface: SpriteBatch is operational. Simple 2D games have been tested with positive results.

The status of the implementation of 3D graphics in MonoXNA is posted in the [3D page](3D.md).

## Audio ##

There's some information about XACT located in the [XnaFrameworkAudio page](XnaFrameworkAudio.md).

## Input ##

The keyboard and mouse is working, but some work needs to be put into getting the gamepad.
